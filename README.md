Instagram “Send” Popup — My Late-Night Clone Project

So, this little project is something I built out of curiosity and caffeine.
It’s a front-end clone of Instagram’s “send/share” popup — that tiny window you see when sharing reels or posts.

It’s a small HTML experiment that turned into a surprisingly fun learning adventure.
Built with just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it actually works across devices and opens real Instagram links — but everything else (like the popup itself) is self-made.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How it started

I don’t even have an Instagram account, but my senior used to send me reel links all the time.
When I forwarded them to friends, the pop-up still showed his name — and everyone kept asking,

“Wait… who’s this guy?” 😅

That’s what sparked the idea.
I opened the Inspect Element, peeked at the popup code, and thought:

“Hmm… what if I just rebuilt this from scratch?”

And that’s how it began.
With a bit of help from ChatGPT for CSS and JS, I got it working —
and after a few long, late nights, the clone looked almost exactly how I pictured it.

What’s in here: 
index.html             # the main (and only) HTML file  
downloaded.docx        # sample file for testing the download button  
avatar.jpg             # avatar image used in the popup  
instagram-icon.png     # small Instagram logo for the website/favicon  


That’s it — super lightweight, no build tools or extra folders.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How to run it

You don’t even need to set anything up.

Just open the published link on GitHub Pages (or wherever it’s hosted).
It works right away — on desktop, mobile, or tablet — no installs, no servers.

When you click around, it behaves just like a little Instagram send popup,
and yes, it can open actual Instagram links (since that part’s real).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The fun part

What started as a quick experiment turned into a full-on late-night flow state.
I’d tweak one line of CSS, reload the page, fix a pixel, try another font…
Next thing I knew, it was 1 AM — but the popup finally looked right.

That feeling — of turning a rough idea into something that looks real —
is honestly one of the best parts of coding.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What’s next

Right now, the popup is static — it only shows one version.
Next up, I want to make it dynamic:

Randomize the user in the popup

Add smoother animations

Maybe even a dark mode

Basically, make it feel like a real mini app.

A quick word on the “malware” curiosity

Yeah, I mentioned malware — but not in a bad way.
It’s the concept that’s interesting: how things work behind the scenes,
how systems protect themselves, and how thinking like a hacker helps you defend better.

This project doesn’t do anything shady.
No secret downloads, no hidden actions, no impersonation — just front-end fun and curiosity.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Final thoughts

This project taught me a lot about structure, styling, and scripting —
and how real-world UI can be reverse-engineered just by paying attention.

It’s small, but it’s mine — and seeing it come to life was a thrill.
If you’re into front-end, clone real interfaces (ethically!), break them apart, rebuild them — that’s how you really learn.

Thanks for checking out my little experiment —
and here’s to more late-night “what if I tried this?” moments ✨

Quick disclaimer

This project is for learning and UI practice only.
It doesn’t collect data, doesn’t impersonate accounts,
and shouldn’t be used in any harmful way.

Just pure creative exploration.
